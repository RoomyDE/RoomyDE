👋 Hi, I’m @RoomyDE, a code noob who somehow found this GitHub page and now dreams of one day understanding what “Hello, World!” really means.
👀 I’m interested in making games so good they get their own Game of Thrones spinoff, diving into blockchain like it's a treasure chest, and mastering languages like C++, C#, and all frameworks that make the code gods proud.
🌱 I’m currently learning how to create games that make you think, “I wish I had more time to play these,” and learning to be as productive as a caffeinated squirrel. Also, I have a 2.5 GPA, which makes me the unofficial expert in “learning by trial and error”—and right now, coding is my biggest error. Jon Snow knows more than me... and for a fact, he knows nothing.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that make your computer run smoother than a dragon on a joyride through King's Landing.
📫 How to reach me: Send a raven, or just hit me up here—roomyh3@hotmail.com.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him, Lord of the Loops, Debugger of Thrones, Compiler of the Seven Kingdoms
⚡ Fun fact: I have a GPA of 2.5, which is the perfect balance between "I’m learning" and "Please don’t look at my grades," but I can still debug like a champ... eventually.
